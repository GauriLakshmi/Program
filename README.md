We tried to build a random password generator which is of great use in online websites.
We used the rand() function to generate random numbers.
We created a string of all possible characters that the password can contain.
Then for each character, we'll randomly select a character from this String.
Each time we run this program, it will generate a different password due to the random nature of our algorithm.
